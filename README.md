# 🏡 House Price Prediction — A Full-Stack ML Regression Pipeline
#### 📍 Built by Tamaghna Nag (Lord Nag) | 👑 ML Engineer | 🔥 Streamlit + wandb + Scikit-learn Power Stack

---

## 🚀 Overview

**HousePricePrediction** is a production-ready, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting residential house prices based on structured data.

From **data preprocessing** to **multi-model training**, **cross-validation**, **performance visualizations**, and even a **real-time Streamlit dashboard** integrated with **Weights & Biases (wandb)** — this project demonstrates the **full ML lifecycle** done right.

💥 _No notebooks dumped in chaos. No half-baked models. This is elite ML engineering, structured, logged, and deployed._

## 🧠 Models Implemented

Four powerful linear regression algorithms trained, cross-validated, and benchmarked:

| Model        | MAE       | RMSE      | R² Score |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **OLS**      | 18266.65  | 29557.71  | 0.8861   |
| **Ridge**    | 19106.48  | 29653.51  | 0.8854   |
| **Lasso**    | 17971.00  | 28311.78  | **0.8955** ✅ Best
| **ElasticNet** | 18638.18 | 31887.18  | 0.8674   |

🔍 All scores were tracked and visualized live via [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/nagtamaghna-oxford-vision-and-sensor-technology/house-price-prediction)
